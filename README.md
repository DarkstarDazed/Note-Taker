# Note-Taker

## Descrption:

Using express.js as my backend, I built a simple note taker using javascipt that allows the user to input title text and note text. When saving the note, it populates a list on the side with other saved notes. 

To use the app, run npm i in your teminal followed by node server.js to spin up the server. Navigate to http://localhost:3001 in your browser and start taking notes.  It is accesible via Heroku as well (see link below).
